Poems by Lewis Carrol

<div id="para1">
<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
</div>

<div id="para2">
<h2>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</h2>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!'
</div>

<div id="para3">
<h3>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</h3>
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.
</div>

<div id="para4">
<h4>And, as in uffish thought he stood,</h4>
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
</div>

<div id="para5">
<h5>One two! One two! And through and through</h5>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.
</div>

<div id="para6">
<h6>'And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?</h6>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.
</div>

<div id="para7"
<h5>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</h5>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.
</div>

<div id="para8"
<h4>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h4>
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
</div>

<div id="para9">
<h3>The moon was shining sulkily,</h3>
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'
</div>

<div id="para10"
<h2>The sea was wet as wet could be,</h2>
The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
No cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to fly.
</div>

<div id="para11"
<h1>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h1>
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'
</div>

<div id="para12">
<h2>'If seven maids with seven mops</h2>
Swept it for half a year,
Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,
'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.

<div id="para13">
<h3>'O Oysters, come and walk with us!</h3>
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'
</div>

<div id="para14">
<h4>The eldest Oyster looked at him,</h4>
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.
</div>

<div id="para15">
<h5>Out four young Oysters hurried up.</h5>
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.
</div>

<div id="para16">
<h6>Four other Oysters followed them,</h6>
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.
</div>

<div id="para17">
<h5>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h5>
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.
</div>

<div id="para18">
<h4>'The time has come,' the Walrus said,</h4>
'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'
</div>

<div id="para19">
<h3>'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,</h3>
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.
</div>

<div id="para20">
<h2>'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,</h2>
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'
</div>

<div id="para21">
<h1>'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,</h1>
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'
</div>

<div id="para22">
<h2>'It was so kind of you to come!</h2>
And you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask you twice!'
</div>

<div id="para23">
<h3>'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,</h3>
'To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'
</div>

<div id="para24">
<h4>'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:</h4>
'I deeply sympathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size,
Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.
</div>

<div id="para25">
<h5>'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,</h5>
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because
They'd eaten every one.
